# my first yaml

# first the YAML, have three principal data structures
# scalars, sequences, maps

# Example of SCALAR
# a scalar is a pure and simple data at the first indentation level
# they can be [a-z][0-9][specialCharacters]
# they can be separated by _ or -
value-one: hello world
_value-two: hello there @@@
23#a:this is a value # wrong the should start with a letter or underscore
[hi, there]: this is a third scalar # wrong the should start with a letter or underscore

# at the first examples, teh scalar is 'hello world'

this: is-value # scalar = is-value
active: false # scalar = active
state: the inner state # scalar = the inner state
# a scalar, or value, support spaces

# Example of SEQUENCES
# The sequences are similar to a list of elements
# They are delimited by a -, separated by a space with their value
# the indentation delimit the level of them
my_list:
  - item one
  - item two
  - item three

my_todo:
  - todo 1
  - todo 2
  - todo 3

# Example of MAPS
# they can be [a-z][0-9]
# they can be separated by _ or -
# they're delimited by indentation at the same level
# their key should be unique 
my-map:
  name: ricardo
  last-name: hernandez
